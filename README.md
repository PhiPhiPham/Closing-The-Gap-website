## What is the gap? 
In Australia, "The Gap" refers to the significant disparities in health, education, employment, and overall well-being between Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples) and non-Indigenous Australians. These disparities are often collectively referred to as "Closing the Gap." The initiative aims to address and reduce these inequalities.

1. Health
2. Education
3. Employment
4. Housing
5. Population statistics
6. Life expectancy
