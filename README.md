# Closing the gap website
## What is the gap? 
In Australia, "The Gap" refers to the significant disparities in health, education, employment, and overall well-being between Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples) and non-Indigenous Australians. These disparities are often collectively referred to as "Closing the Gap." The initiative aims to address and reduce these inequalities.

## About this project

1. Health
2. Education
3. Employment
4. Housing
5. Justice
6. Life expectancy
7.
